# macosxsdk

In order to build the OpenJDK native libraries for OS X on a Windows or Linux operating system, a packaged OS X SDK needs to be be placed in this directory at `macosxsdk`.

Apple redistribution rights prevent us from including or posting this SDK.

One can be generated by following the directions of the osxcross project at https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross/blob/master/README.md.

The easiest way to generate this is to download the `XCode 11.3.1.xip` file from Apple and run osxcross' tools/gen_sdk_package_pbzx.sh on that file. This will extract the required SDK components and place them in a .tar.xz file. This tar should then be extracted into the 'macosxsdk' directory here. Ensure when extracting on Windows that symlinks are either dereferenced, or supported.
